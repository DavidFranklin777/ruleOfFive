# ruleOfFive
Rule of five in C++ is an important concept.
This states that if it is necessary to create any of the following, then all the following must be implemented.
Otherwise we encounter what is known as shallow copy.
This is necessary when we use pointers.
1. Copy constructor
2. Assignment operator overloading
3. Destructor
4. Move constructor
5. Move operator overloading
